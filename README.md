# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Benin Dataset

## Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset from Benin to gain insights into various parameters and trends. The analysis includes detailed statistical measures, data visualizations, and observations to understand the dataset comprehensively. The project is implemented using Python within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Objectives

1. **Data Understanding**:

   - Explore the structure, dimensions, and summary of the dataset.
   - Identify key variables and their roles.

2. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect entries.
   - Address outliers and standardize data formats.

3. **Exploratory Analysis**:

   - Compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
   - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends.

4. **Insights and Observations**:
   - Identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables.

## Features of the Analysis

### 1. Summary Statistics

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
- Identification of minimum, maximum, and range values for each numeric column.

### 2. Data Visualization

- Line and bar charts to visualize trends over time.
- Scatter plots for correlation analysis.
- Histograms and boxplots for data distribution.
- Heatmaps for visualizing correlations.

### 3. Outlier Detection

- Z-score and IQR methods to identify significant outliers.

### 4. Correlation Analysis

- Pair plots and correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables.

### 5. Data Cleaning

- Addressing missing values with appropriate strategies (e.g., imputation, deletion).
- Removing or handling anomalies in the dataset.
